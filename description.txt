✅ Current Version Summary (le nul.html)
This file is a highly customized, standalone HTML/CSS/JS gallery viewer designed to simulate a luxurious, immersive gallery space (called “Temple of Design”) showcasing artworks inside ornate frames.

🔧 Core Features Present:
HTML/CSS/JS only – no external framework used (no React, Vue, etc.).

Styling: Custom responsive layout using vanilla CSS with luxury branding (gold colors, marble, shadows).

Animated elements:

Entrance fade transition

Floating particles

Gallery item hover shadows

Glimmer effect on active artworks

Functional UI/UX:

Clickable frames that open modals with details

Scroll/drag horizontally through artworks

Keyboard arrow support

Panel to edit artwork metadata and upload a new image

File upload includes WebP compression and progress bar

Data Persistence: Uses localStorage to save edits and gallery state locally.

No server backend: Entirely frontend, all artwork data is handled client-side.

Lightweight compression: Uploads are optimized via browser-image-compression (WebP).

🔴 Current Limitations:
Can’t be deployed or embedded as a plugin easily without external wrapping.

Maintenance gets harder as the code grows – especially CSS and JavaScript.

No modular components or reusable structure.

Poor scalability for large galleries or real-time collaboration.

Not SEO-friendly if content is dynamic.

No image CDN or server upload fallback.
